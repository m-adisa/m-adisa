## Portfolio Projects
- [Project Pepper](https://github.com/Codart-7/) is an inventory management system API designed to help the user track and manage inventory levels, and related activities. It includes a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to improve security by limiting access to sensitive data and system functionality only to authorized users.
